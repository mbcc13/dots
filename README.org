* Dots
My mess of dotfiles.

I dont really use any of these at the present moment. Sooner or later i wall get back to using and editing my configs.

** Neovim
Neovim has been moved to a differant git hosting site. I do not really use that much either, I have been trying out [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs!]]
