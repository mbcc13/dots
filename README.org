* Dots
My mess of dotfiles.

+I don't really use any of these at the present moment. Sooner or later i will get back to using and editing my configs.+
/*I am back*/ 
I plan on switching back to nixos from fedora, i'm getting my old config upto date.

** Neovim
Neovim has been moved to a different git hosting site. I do not really use that much either, I have been trying out [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs!]]
